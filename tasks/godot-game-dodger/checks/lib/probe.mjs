// moves -- falling hazards, scrolling stars, particles -- keeps moving the
// same way regardless of the key, so it is noise, and it is the noise that
// sank every magnitude/sign/t-statistic version of this gate.
//
// Erase that noise instead of trying to out-argue it: capture the canvas
// several times WHILE THE KEY IS STILL HELD and take the per-cell, per-
// channel MEDIAN. A hazard occupies any given cell for only a fraction of
// the capture window, so that cell's median is the background. The held

// on the reference dodger (300 px/s across a 612 px range, so 2.04 s edge to

// enough either: a real platformer submission ran its player at 245 px/s
// across the full 960 px level (3.9 s edge to edge), so both holds captured
// a still-moving player, the median erased it both times and the two
// medians were identical. 4000 ms covers a full-width traversal at any
// speed from ~240 px/s up. The noise floor's two frames are taken the same

// changes two regions of that size, the cells it left and the cells it
// now occupies, for 8.2 cell-areas. The diff sums |delta| over all four
// channels, but an opaque canvas has a constant alpha, so only the three
// color channels contribute: 8.2 * 3 * C, where C is the object-vs-
// background per-channel contrast. Taking a deliberately weak C = 64 (a
// quarter of the 0-255 range) gives 8.2 * 3 * 64 = 1574, rounded to 1600.

// changed by 20-30), while the reference dodger's live meteors summed to
// 1800-5800 (few cells, each changed by 100+). No sum separates those; the
// per-cell amplitude does. A pair's motion is the number of channel values
// that changed by MOTION_DELTA or more. Measured at the 96 x 96 signature,
// 75 ms apart: that dodger's dead screen (starfield still scrolling) has 5
// to 28 per pair; the same game alive has 157 to 297; the reference dodger,

// 55 / 126 = 0.44. A capture with fewer than FROZEN_MOVING_PAIRS moving
// pairs out of CAPTURES - 1 is frozen. Live hazards move in every pair. The
// bar sits at 6 of 7 so that a death INSIDE the capture window (half the

// --- Telling a pinned player apart from a dead one -------------------------

// `frozen` on its own is ambiguous, and both readings are real: a platformer
// with static scenery is frozen when its player is correctly pinned against
// an edge, while a dodger that has just died is frozen on a game-over screen
// with its hazards stopped mid-fall. What disambiguates them is a fact about
// the game measured BEFORE any key is touched: does anything on this screen
// move by itself? Two back-to-back idle median frames answer it. If the
// scene animates when left alone, a frozen capture means the game stopped,
// and that capture is worthless -- it is the game-over screen, not the
// player's position. If the scene does not animate, frozen is the normal
// state and means nothing either way.
//
// Getting this wrong is not a small error. On the benchmark machine, real dodgers that
// freeze the whole scene on game over produced floors of 40571 and scores
// of 29900, because a no-key floor sample was comparing a LIVE median frame
// (hazards averaged away) against a FROZEN game-over frame (hazards still
// there). Those are not measurements of anything.
//
// The measurement here is per-pair motion (motionCount) on the first
// capture, which doubles as the run's live reference for every later
// frozen decision. revive presses Space, which on a platformer is jump, so
// that first capture can catch a player mid-jump; a jump moves one or two
// of its seven pairs, and the median over the seven ignores that, so a
// static-scenery platformer stays classed as static. Reading a transient
// like that as "the scene animates" once made every later frozen capture

// --- The instantaneous test: for players that never hold still -------------

// off the edge, fall, respawn at the start, walk off again. It is perfectly
// steerable, but it is never still in EITHER direction, so the median erases
// it both times and the pinned diff collapses. That is a real submission the
// benchmark failed twice: per-axis D of 63 to 235 against a floor of ~220, on a
// game whose screenshots show it steering fine.
//
// So: stop waiting for stillness. Tap a direction for TAP_MS, grab ONE raw
// frame while the key is still down, tap the opposite direction, grab one
// more, and diff those. No median, no pinning. The player is simply at two
// different places in two single frames, which on a static-scenery game is
// two clearly separated blobs and comfortably over ABS_MIN, while a game
// whose movement keys do nothing gives a diff of about zero.
//
// The price is that this test has no defence at all against ambient motion:
// one raw frame TAP_MS after another includes every meteor that moved in
// between. On a busy scene the instantaneous floor is therefore large, and
// the 3x rule means this test simply cannot return a pass there. That is
// deliberate, not a gap -- on those games the pinned test is the one that

// noise floor AND at least ABS_MIN. Within a test, axes are tried in order
// and it stops at the first decisive one: arrows first, then WASD, since a
// game that binds only WASD is still playable.
//
//   1. Pinned (above): HOLD_MS holds, median frames, immune to ambient motion
//      but blind to a player that never holds still.
//   2. Instantaneous (above): 400 ms taps, single raw frames, blind to
//      nothing about the player but wide open to ambient motion.
//
// They fail in opposite directions, which is the point of running both. The
// pinned test goes first because it is the one that works on busy games,
// where the instantaneous test's floor is too high to ever pass. The
// instantaneous test only runs when the pinned test decided nothing, and it
// is what reads the static-scene games with no pinned state.
//
// Known limits: a game that reacts only through audio or off-canvas UI
// passes neither, since both read only the canvas. Nor does a busy game
// whose player never holds still, which is the one square both tests leave
// empty: the pinned test cannot see the player and the instantaneous test
// cannot see past the hazards.
//
// Runtime budget for one invocation. Load and settle ~5 s; one median
// frame ~0.8 s (7 x 75 ms of gaps plus the per-capture evaluate, now at
// 96 x 96); the animation probe ~2.5 s; one hold in a fresh life = revive
// 0.85 s + HOLD_MS + a median ~= 5.7 s, so a pinned floor sample or trial
// (two holds) is ~11.5 s; the pinned floor is ~35 s and one pinned axis
// ~35 s. Four pinned axes plus the preamble is ~180 s. The instantaneous
// test is far cheaper: its floor is ~1.5 s and a trial is ~2.1 s, so all
// four of its axes cost ~26 s. A clean run that exhausts both tests is
// ~210 s; one decided on the first pinned axis is ~75 s.
//
// The two deadlines bound the retries, which are what can otherwise run
// away: a game that dies during every hold would pay MAX_RETRIES + 1
// attempts on every floor sample and every trial. Past a deadline no new
// axis of that phase is started and no further retry is attempted, so the
// tail is one already-running axis.
//
// The pinned phase gets the larger share because on a busy scene it is the
// ONLY test that can pass: the instantaneous test's floor is too high there
// by construction. A dodger that dies every few seconds needs its retries
// on every hold, and a WASD-only game needs the third axis reached; at a
// budget that stopped after the two arrow axes, a real WASD-only dodger
// never had its a/d axis started. INST_DEADLINE_MS caps the whole run; the
// instantaneous phase is skipped outright when less than
// INST_MIN_BUDGET_MS is left, since a floor plus one axis is the smallest
