# Export every Godot reference solution into references/<name>-built/ so
# calibrate can grade it. References are committed as project source only;
# a Godot submission is only gradable with its web export, and calibrate
# grades <name>-built in place of <name> when both exist. Exports use the
# godot-web-games Workbench image and its own game-export tool, the same
# toolchain the Workbench arm has. naive-no-export (marked .skip-export) is
# left as source on purpose: shipping no build is the failure it models.
#
# Usage, from the repository root: bash scripts/build-godot-references.sh
# Needs Docker on linux/amd64 (the image pins amd64 downloads).
